- 👋 Hi, I’m @dandrichest
- 👀 I’m interested in web2, web3

- 🌱 I am a current BYU-Pathway Worldwide student working on my Web and Computer Programming certificate as I pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Development. I have already earned a degree in Information Technology (2012). I am currently seeking employment that will help me leverage my educational background and passion for web and software development to make a meaningful impact in the professional world. While open to all opportunities, I prefer remote work. My educational journey at BYU-Pathway has provided me with foundational skills needed in the workplace. I have an aptitude for learning and am open to opportunities for personal and professional growth. Serving as manager of Daniel's Mega Int'l Ltd a small business that offers financial services and retail trade online and offline, has taught me the joy of bringing people together to achieve a worthy goal.
